Waiting at most 5 seconds for missing files.
MissingOutputException in line 46 of /xdisk/bhurwitz/mig2020/rsgrps/bhurwitz/alise/my_scripts/Viral_hunt_snakemake/Snakefile:
Job completed successfully, but some output files are missing. Missing files after 5 seconds:
results/Vibrant/VIBRANT_short2_renamed/VIBRANT_log_short2_renamed.log
This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait.
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
